<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  As a Product Manager with a passion for Product Manager for fintech innovation 
  have had the incredible opportunity to contribute to transformative projects at 
  two leading companies: Shopee and M1.
</p>
<p>
  During my tenure at Shopee, I honed my product management skills by working on a 
  diverse range of projects. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I successfully 
  led the development and launch of customer-centric features that significantly enhanced 
  the user experience. These experiences have shaped my keen understanding of the e-commerce 
  landscape and the importance of leveraging technology to meet evolving consumer needs.

<p>
  At M1, my focus has shifted to the fintech sector, aligning perfectly with my long-term goal. 
  Leading the launch of multiple innovative fintech solutions has given me the opportunity to merge
  my passion for technology and finance, propelling me towards making a significant and purposeful impact 
  in this rapidly evolving field.

<p>
  Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) enthusiast. This discipline has 
  taught me valuable lessons in perseverance, adaptability, and continuous improvement â€“ qualities that I 
  carry into my work as a Product Manager. Embracing the challenges of BJJ has strengthened my problem-solving 
  skills and ability to navigate complex situations, both on and off the mat.
